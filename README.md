# 🎯 Pattern Recognition Process  

## 📌 Overview  
This project demonstrates a **complete pattern recognition pipeline**, applying **image processing techniques** to analyze and recognize patterns in binary images. The process consists of **six key steps**, each playing a crucial role in extracting meaningful information from raw data.  

## 🔬 Pattern Recognition Steps  
The pipeline follows **six fundamental steps**:  

1️⃣ **Noise Reduction by Blurring** – Smooths out image noise using blurring techniques to enhance pattern clarity.  
2️⃣ **Histogram Analysis** – Generates and analyzes the intensity distribution of the image.  
3️⃣ **Correlation** – Measures the similarity between patterns for feature matching.  
4️⃣ **Thresholding** – Converts grayscale images to binary by applying intensity thresholds.  
5️⃣ **Connectivity Analysis** – Identifies and labels connected regions within the binary image.  
6️⃣ **Calculating the Properties of Binary Regions** – Extracts shape properties such as area, perimeter, centroid, and aspect ratio.
